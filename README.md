PIC18F4620 Driver Library

This repository provides a collection of low-level drivers for various peripherals of the PIC18F4620 microcontroller, written entirely in C. These drivers offer a user-friendly interface to interact with the hardware and simplify embedded system development.

Supported Peripherals:

-General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO): Control digital pins for input or output operations.
-Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC): Convert analog signals from external sensors into digital values.
-Capture/Compare/PWM (CCP): Generate precise timing signals or capture external events.
-Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM): Store non-volatile data that persists even after power cycles.
-Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C): Facilitate communication with I2C-compliant devices like sensors and displays.
-Interrupts: Respond to events efficiently using interrupt service routines (ISRs).
-Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI): Enable high-speed communication with SPI peripherals like memory cards or LCDs.
-Timers 0, 1, 2, and 3: Create various timing delays, generate waveforms, and implement real-time functions.
-Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART): Enable serial communication for data transmission and reception.
